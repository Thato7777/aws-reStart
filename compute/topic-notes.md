# Compute Notes

## What is Compute?

Compute is the processing power that lets your application run. In the cloud, this usually refers to virtual machines, containers, or serverless functions.

### Examples
- EC2 (virtual servers)
- Lambda (serverless functions)
- ECS/Fargate (containers)

## Key Concepts
- Scaling (vertical vs horizontal)
- AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)
- Load Balancers

## Reflection
I now understand that compute is not just about "running code"â€”it's about choosing the right type of resource for performance, cost, and maintenance.
