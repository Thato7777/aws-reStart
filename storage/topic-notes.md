# Storage Notes

## Types of Storage
- S3: Object storage
- EBS: Block storage for EC2
- EFS: Network file system

## Use Cases
- S3 for static websites and file backups
- EBS for app data (like databases)
- EFS for shared file access across instances

## Reflection
Understanding the difference between object and block storage helped me figure out when to use each service.
